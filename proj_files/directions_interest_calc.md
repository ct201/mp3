## Directions: Interest Calculator
Remember that there are two types of interest - simple interest and compound interest. For this assignment, you'll need to create a function to calculate each.

# Simple Interest
Simple interest is calculated as $I = P \times \frac{R}{100} \times T$ where $P$ is the principal, $R$ is the interest rate, and $T$ is the amount of time.

# Compound Interest
Compound interest is when interest is earned on previously earned interest. It's formula is given by $A = P(1 + \frac{\frac{r}{100}}{n})^{nt}$ where $A$ is the final amount, $P$ is the intial principal, $r$ is the interest rate, $n$ is the number of times compounded during a single time period, and $t$ is the number of time periods.
